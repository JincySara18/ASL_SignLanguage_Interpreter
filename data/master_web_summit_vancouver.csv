websummit-vancouver,https://lu.ma/websummit-vancouver,Vancouver AI: May 28 #WebSummit,"​Technology isn't neutral and neither are we. Vancouver AI is assembling the brain trust of BC's AI ecosystem—researchers with revolutionary vision, artists with computational minds, and builders who question what they're building. ​Our keynotes aren't corporate retreads—they're field reports from the edge, raw transmissions from explorers who've gone beyond the algorithm and returned with something worth sharing. ​This isn't about what AI can do—it's about what we can become when we stop treating technology as something that happens to us and start wielding it like the strange, beautiful tool it is. ​We're the intersection where diverse disciplines, backgrounds, and interests converge to explore our shared humanity in the age of AI. All welcome, no gatekeeping. Bring your projects, your questions, your wild ideas—this is where the future gets built together. ​The machines are learning. Are we? Join the conversation that matters. ​​Want to speak? Have an insight that isn't ""AI will change everything""? ​​Built something weird? Demo spots open. ​​Join the community: Get in the Vancouver AI CORE Group where the real conversations happen ​Vancouver AI CORE just booted up. 12-month passport to every gathering. Backdoor access to our Members Group Chat & Knowledge Base for raw, unfiltered dialogues. Something built by the community, for the community. ​This isn't subscription content—it's community infrastructure. The digital campfire where tomorrow's questions get asked today. ​Initialize: https://core.bc-ai.net/ ​​H.R.

Together we're co-creating understanding. ​No outsiders calling the shots, no Silicon Valley hypercapitalist agenda—just a self-organizing system of people who give a damn about where this technological revolution is taking us and who gets to steer. ​Vancouver AI was just the start. BC's AI Ecosystem continues to grow, with new community hubs emerging in Surrey, Victoria, Kelowna, and beyond—each contributing unique perspectives to a thriving, interconnected network. ​BC + AI represents a collective, province-wide effort to democratize AI knowledge, innovation, and opportunity. If you're in Surrey (or nearby!), come join the movement and connect with fellow AI explorers. ​​Limited to 200 human bodies ​​Will sell out, just like every other VAI event ​​Bring stickers to trade.

Web Summit Vancouver Afterparty","​Tired of Harvard tie-wearing business (pseudo)graduates asking you about your MAU and GTM strategies for your open source project? Or maybe you're sick of being asked if you have plans to incorporate AI for your C code that’s only to be deployed to a low-powered microcontroller? Tired of the eyerolls you get when you can’t have answers to any of them, even if you try to explain to them? ​Well, so are we. This is why we are bringing together some of the brightest, most talented technical people to mix, mingle, share ideas, and learn from each other. ​This is an event where you’re going to be respected for being a valuable contributor to society, as tech professionals and hobbyists.
