That obsession with experience led me from film to front-end, from user flows to Figma frames.⚡️ Fast-forward to today: I’m a Product Designer with 4+ years of experience designing and shipping B2B SaaS, AI, and EdTech products—from 0→1 builds to scaling design systems and driving growth. Whether it’s building an LMS for 2M+ learners, designing a sales chatbot with AI-driven insights, or prototyping game-based tools for social wellness—I thrive at the intersection of design, business, and behavior.Currently based in Toronto, I’m looking to join a team that moves fast, cares deeply about the user, and builds with purpose.Let’s make something meaningful together → hireabhaychopra@gmail.comMore at: www.theabhaychopra.comI didn’t start in product design.
